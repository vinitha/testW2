          <p><strong>&quot;</strong> Do You Need More Sales are brilliant. I would highly recommend them to anyone thinking of reviewing their sales and marketing strategy.</p>
		  <p>Although Alan was recommended to me, I had my doubts initially because we are based in Canberra and Alan is in Perth, these doubts were quick to disappear after speaking with him and the reassurances that he gave us. </p>
          <p>I have never experienced better service and his communication during the process was outstanding.</p>
		  <p>Keep up the great work Alan.<strong>&quot;</strong></p>

          <p><strong>&quot;</strong> I needed to look at alternative methods for advertising and promoting a new part of my busines: www.allthingsroofing.net.au.</p>
		  <p>I discussed my intentions with 4 companies and can honestly say that Alan was the only one who “understood” what I wanted, in addition he was also able to suggest other things that I had not even thought of.<strong>&quot;</strong></p>

          <p><strong>&quot;</strong>If you are thinking about looking for ways to generate more business for your company via the various online options, then working with Alan at Do You Need More Sales – is the absolute right decision.</p>
		  <p>Alan is super knowledgeable, extremely well networked with lots of local business and a skilled professional.<strong>&quot;</strong></p>
